The Virtual DNA Lab (VDNA-Lab) software provides an easy to use graphical interface for creating, running and visualizing synthetic simulations for DNA assembly systems, such as assembly of DNA nanostructures, strand displacement cascades systems, DNA-tile assembly etc. It uses the NFsim computational modeling engine to run simulations and generate outputs. These outputs can be visualized using the VDNA-Lab's visualization tool, which allows also some further analysis of the simulation output.

Features:

The tool consists of three main functionalities, each reachable from one of the specific tab's above:
- "Create Test Tube" for creating new test tube input files,
- "Run Experiment" for simulating the assembly process within a given input test tube file, and
- "Visualize Test Tube" for visualizing the content of a test tube at the beginning, middle, or end of an experiment.
